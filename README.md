## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

This is my final design. It is inspired by the Braille language, as well as the Semaphore flag signalling system. As the viewer can see, it is not particularly readable, nor does it resemble the English alphabet or Arabic numerals. However, this was ultimately my goal when I began work on this problem set. The final colour scheme is a range of colours that have good contrast between not only the background, but also themselves. I wanted to pick colours that are bright and noticeable against the dark navy back. I think that this was an effective design decision. 

In terms of stroke colour and weight, I decided to remove both. I wanted the design to be as clean and as minimal as possible and adding different stroke colours and different stroke weights took away from this effect. 

Although the letters when side by side sequentially look similar, when they are used normally in words, they are more distinguishable, yet still appearing to be coherent and of the same theme. This was my goal when I started this design and I am happy with how it has been met. 

Further design experimentation could have involved testing with different shapes, such as arcs, lines and triangles. 

The final parameters per letter are as follows: 
   "squareSize”
    "offset”
    "offset”
    "circleSize”
    "offsetCirclex"
    "offsetCircleY"
